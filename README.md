# Automated-Image-Cataloging-Reporting-Workflow
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully automated workflow using Make (formerly Integromat) integrated with Google Sheets and Gmail. The workflow fetches image data via API calls, processes it through advanced pagination, and organizes the results into a structured Google Sheets catalog. Each entry includes both the image URL and a descriptive metadata field, enabling efficient content management and retrieval.

## Key features include:

API Integration & Pagination: Automated retrieval of large datasets with advanced pagination logic.

Data Processing: Iteration and aggregation of image descriptions for streamlined organization.

Google Sheets Integration: Real-time population of a catalog with image URLs and descriptive metadata.

Automated Notifications: Email reports sent via Gmail to keep stakeholders updated on new entries.

Scalability: Configured to run every 15 minutes, ensuring continuous synchronization and up-to-date records.

This project highlights expertise in workflow automation, API handling, and cross-platform integration, showcasing how complex data pipelines can be simplified into efficient, reusable systems.
